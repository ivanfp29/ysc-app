Mobile application for YSC2019 event. 

The York Science Conference is The first student-run science-based conference
in Europe, dedicated to exploring new developments in science and technology.

As Chief Technology Officer and a Founding Executive Committee Member, I have opted to 
create a mobile app for delegates of the conference, to boost engagement and the experience as a whole.
